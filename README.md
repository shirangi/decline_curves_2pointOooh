# Decline Curves 2.Oooh

- Conventional decline curve models cannot account for changing conditions
- Recurrent neural networks (RNN) process temporal data
- Temporal data may be used to represent changes in conditions during a wellâ€™s lifetime
- This provides means for a new decline curve modeling framework
- This new framework is able to account for refracking, well interactins and more
