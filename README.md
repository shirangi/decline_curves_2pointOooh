A PyTorch application for next-generation decline curve modelling. The package is named `luibeal` (Lewis and Beal, 1918).

- Conventional decline curve models are not intended for changing conditions
- Recurrent neural networks (RNN) can process temporal data
- These temporal data may be used to represent changes in conditions during a well’s lifetime
- This provides means for a new decline curve modeling framework
- The new framework is able to account for refracking, well interactions and more

PyTorch has chosen a somewhat tight alignment with Anaconda, so this project falls in line given the strong dependency. So standard procedure using a virtual environment would then be
```
conda create -n dcenv
source activate dcenv
conda env update -f environment.yml -n dcenv
python setup.py
```
which creates an environment, activates it, installs dependecies and gets you out of the environment. Optionally you can specify `python setup.py develop` Alternatively, you can create the environment in one go and step into it later, all set up.
```
conda env create -f environment.yml -n dcenv
python setup.py
```
There is also a dockerfile which provided the required development environment - once in the container, cd into the mapped directory and `python setup.py`. Also, no need for GPU, this is kindergarden.
